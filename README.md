# important
At time of pushing code during class exam i accidententialy delete all the code in git hub so just i pushed it one more time. 

autocompletion summery

First i created a separate reusable autocomplete component that can used across whole website.
Then i added a random api to demonstrate network requests.
After that i added a autocomplete input in which a function gets called namely getasyncdata() which implements debounce logic

Debounce logic is light on api i.e it doesn't put pressure on API server.
It requests for data after every 500 milliseconds.
on every input key the function will get called and then data will be fetched and filled in the search results array.nput key depicts a keypress.
https://api.themoviedb.org/
this api is used for dummy data,when keyboard goes completely idle for 500 milliseconds,it calls server and gets new data

# I am deploying the node.js backend in the server.


#My app works well in localhost but I am facing issues while i am deploying to the heroku.
